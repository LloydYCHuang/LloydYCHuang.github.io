## Hi! I am Lloyd!  
  
I am a Master's student in Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University. My current research centers on the application of proximal sensors including Vis/NIR/SWIR spectroradiometers (ASD FieldSpec 3) and Portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF) to elucidate pedological questions. I have a broad interest in questions involved in biogeochemical cycle and seek an opportunity to pursue a Doctoral degree overseas.  
Feel free to contact me through email (r09623007@ntu.edu.tw) and Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/LloydYCHuang" target="_blank">@LloydYCHuang</a>). For more information, check out my CV and Research page!
