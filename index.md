## Hi, I am Lloyd. <br> I am a research assistant, soil surveyor, and future scientist.

I am Yin-Chung (Lloyd) Huang, a research assistant at the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University. I have a broad interest in questions involved in the biogeochemical cycle and will start my PhD student at the University of Sydney in late 2023. I am passionate about research work and hold enthusiasm toward soil science. In short, I want to be a scientist in the future.  
   
I study the origin and evolution of soils, which is called pedogenesis. With the knowledge of understanding the continuous process of soil formation, I am expecting to deal with issues including climate change, sustainable production, smart agriculture, and even planetary exploration! My present research focuses on the application of proximal sensors including Vis/NIR/SWIR spectroradiometers (ASD FieldSpec 3) and Portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF) to elucidate pedological questions.   
  
To date, I have published three peer-reviewed papers. The most recent one is published in the journal Geoderma (SCI, IF = 7.422) titled "Using pXRF and Vis-NIR for characterizing diagnostic horizons of fine-textured podzolic soils in subtropical forests." We used proximal sensors and algorithms to classify the horizons of podzolic soils, which have a significant accumulation of organo-metallic complexes. The k-means clustering successfully separated O/A, E, B, and C horizons, and we expect such methods can be applied in situ in the future. 
   
My major extracurricular activity is Model United Nations (MUN). I participated as a delegate in Harvard World MUN at Montreal, Canada, as a lecturer in club courses, and as a chair in an official MUN held by New Taipei City Government. In my spare time, I enjoy jogging and hiking, and I participated in the NTU Campus Marathon (5 km) over four years.  
   
I am a dreamer and am ready for a PhD adventure. I will conduct my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Budiman Minasny. For more information, check out my CV and Research pages.
