I am Lloyd, a Master's student in Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University. I have a broad interest in questions involved in biogeochemical cycle and seek an opportunity to pursue a Doctoral degree overseas. My current research centers on the application of proximal sensors including Vis/NIR/SWIR spectroradiometers (ASD FieldSpec 3) and Portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF) to elucidate pedological questions. To date, I have one peer-reviewed paper published on journal Geoderma Regional (IF = 2.807), and I am currently working on the submission of the second one!
