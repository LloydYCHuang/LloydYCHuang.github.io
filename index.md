I am Lloyd, a Master's student in the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University. I have a broad interest in questions involved in the biogeochemical cycle and seek an opportunity to pursue a Doctoral degree overseas. In short, I want to be a scientist in the future.  
   
I study the origin and evolution of soils, which is called pedogenesis. With the knowledge of understanding the continuous process of soil formation, I am expecting to deal with issues including climate change, sustainable production, smart agriculture, or even planetary exploration! My research focuses on the application of proximal sensors including Vis/NIR/SWIR spectroradiometers (ASD FieldSpec 3) and Portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate pedological questions. To date, I have published one peer-reviewed paper on the journal Geoderma Regional (IF = 2.807) regarding the distribution of available Si in forest soils and paddy fields in Taiwan. Currently, I am working on the submission of the second article about the differentiation of fine-textured Spodosols in central Taiwan.  
   
My major extracurricular activity is Model United Nations (MUN). I participated as a delegate in Harvard World MUN at Montreal, Canada, as a lecturer in club courses, and as a chair in an official MUN held by New Taipei City Government. In my spare time, I enjoy jogging and hiking, and I participated in the NTU Campus Marathon (5 km) over three years. Also, I like to play video games, and my favorites include Horizon Zero Dawn, Monster Hunter, and Sekiro.
   
I am a dreamer and looking forward to a PhD adventure. Feel free to contact me through email (r09623007@ntu.edu.tw) and Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/LloydYCHuang" target="_blank">@LloydYCHuang</a>). For more information, check out my CV and Research page!
