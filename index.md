## Hi, I am Lloyd. <br> I am a Master's student, soil surveyor, and future scientist.

I am Yin-Chung (Lloyd) Huang, a Master's student at the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University. I have a broad interest in questions involved in the biogeochemical cycle and seek an opportunity to pursue a Doctoral degree overseas. In short, I want to be a scientist in the future.  
   
I study the origin and evolution of soils, which is called pedogenesis. With the knowledge of understanding the continuous process of soil formation, I am expecting to deal with issues including climate change, sustainable production, smart agriculture, or even planetary exploration! My present research focuses on the application of proximal sensors including Vis/NIR/SWIR spectroradiometers (ASD FieldSpec 3) and Portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate pedological questions.   
  
To date, I have published two peer-reviewed paper. The most recent one is published in the journal Geoderma (SCI, IF = 7.422) titled "Differentiation of fine-textured podzolic soils controlled by climate and landscape in Taiwan". The other one is in the journal Geoderma Regional (IF = 4.201) regarding the distribution of available Si in forest soils and paddy fields in Taiwan. Currently, I am working on the submission of the second article about the differentiation of fine-textured Spodosols in central Taiwan.  
   
My major extracurricular activity is Model United Nations (MUN). I participated as a delegate in Harvard World MUN at Montreal, Canada, as a lecturer in club courses, and as a chair in an official MUN held by New Taipei City Government. In my spare time, I enjoy jogging and hiking, and I participated in the NTU Campus Marathon (5 km) over three years.  
   
I am a dreamer and looking forward to a PhD adventure. In late 2022, I will start my application for PhD program! For more information, check out my CV and Research pages.
