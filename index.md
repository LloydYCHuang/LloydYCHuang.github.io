## Hi, I am Lloyd. <br> I am a PhD student, soil lover, and future scientist.

I am Yin-Chung (Lloyd) Huang, a PhD student at the University of Sydney. I have a broad interest in questions involved in the biogeochemical cycle and am thrilled to start my academic journey here in Sydney. I am passionate about research work and hold enthusiasm toward soil science. In short, I want to be a scientist in the future.  
   
I study soil spectroscopy with a domain knowledge of pedogenesis. With the understanding of soil formation, I am expecting to deal with issues including climate change, sustainable production, smart agriculture, and even planetary exploration! My present research focuses on the application of mid-infrared on soil mineralogy and the use of low-cost spectrometers to estimate soil carbon stock.   
  
To date, I have published three peer-reviewed papers. The most recent one is published in the journal Geoderma (IF = 6.1) titled "Using pXRF and Vis-NIR for characterizing diagnostic horizons of fine-textured podzolic soils in subtropical forests." We used proximal sensors and algorithms to classify the horizons of podzolic soils, which have a significant accumulation of organo-metallic complexes. The k-means clustering successfully separated O/A, E, B, and C horizons, and we expect such methods can be applied in situ in the future.  
   
I am a dreamer and am ready for a PhD adventure. I am conducting my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Budiman Minasny. For more information, check out my CV and Research pages.
