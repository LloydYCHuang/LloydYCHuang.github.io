## Proximal sensing
Proximal soil sensing is one of the most important branches in the field of smart agriculture development. My research focuses on the combination of two devices: portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF) and visible and near infrared spectrometer (VisNIR). Through the use of these two sensors, we applies machine learning to build models to predict soil properties with high efficiency. Portable XRF measures the secondary X-ray after the atoms are excited to quantify the concentration of elements, and VisNIR detects the reflectance spectrum between 350 and 2500 nm, which contains absorption features of iron oxides, functional groups of organic matter, and phyllosilicate. Specifically, we are trying to increase the interpretability of machine learning models by applying basic knowledge of pedogenesis. Hence, we selected podzolic soils that possess clear migration of Fe/Al organometallic complexes as study subjects, and pedological explanations will be proposed to validate the prediction models.
